<h1>NUCES circle</h1>

<p>
  This is a professional networking application (similar to
LinkedIn) where students can build their professional profile highlighting their
accomplishments, skills, experiences, interests and semester projects. Students
can build their circle by connecting with other members and also get endorsed
by other fellows or instructors present in Nuces-Circle. This helps recruiters in
searching most appropriate candidate from the campus.
